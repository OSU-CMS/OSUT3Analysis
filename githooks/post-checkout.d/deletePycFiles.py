#A common problem with Python developers occurs when generated .pyc files
#stick around after switching branches. The interpreter sometimes uses these
#.pyc instead of the .py source file. To avoid any confusion, you can delete
#all .pyc files every time you check out a new branch using this post-checkout script:
if is_branch_checkout == "0":
    print "post-checkout: This is a file checkout. Nothing to do."
    sys.exit(0)
